## How to Use

Below is detailed guidance on how to configure and use the Pulse Action.

### Overview

The Pulse Action provides a mechanism for scheduling and triggering periodic tasks. It supports configurations for various use cases, including:

- **Custom schedules** for specific tasks.
- **Integration** with subscribing actions for seamless task execution.
- **Scalability** for handling multiple pulse triggers.

---

### Configuration Structure

The configuration consists of the following components:

### `pulse_settings`

Defines the settings for the pulse action, such as intervals and task parameters.

```python
pulse_settings = {
    "interval": "5m",           # Example: "5m" for 5 minutes, "1h" for 1 hour
    "task": "task_identifier",  # Identifier for the task to be triggered
    "parameters": {             # Task-specific parameters
        "priority": "high",
        "retry": 3
    }
}
```

---

### Example Configurations

### Basic Configuration for a 5-Minute Interval

```python
pulse_settings = {
    "interval": "5m",
    "task": "send_email_notifications",
    "parameters": {
        "priority": "high",
        "retry": 3
    }
}
```

### Best Practices
- Validate your task identifiers and parameters before deployment.
- Test pulse schedules in a staging environment before production use.
