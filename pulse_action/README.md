This action provides a core mechanism for triggering scheduled pulse activities in subscribing actions. As a pulse action, it ensures periodic and timely execution of tasks within the subscribing actions framework. The package is a singleton and requires the Jivas library version 2.0.0.

## Package Information

- **Name:** `jivas/pulse_action`
- **Author:** [V75 Inc.](https://v75inc.com/)
- **Architype:** `PulseAction`

## Meta Information

- **Title:** Pulse Action
- **Group:** core
- **Type:** action

## Configuration

- **Singleton:** true

## Dependencies

- **Jivas:** `^2.0.0`

---

## How to Use

Below is detailed guidance on how to configure and use the Pulse Action.

### Overview

The Pulse Action provides a mechanism for scheduling and triggering periodic tasks. It supports configurations for various use cases, including:

- **Custom schedules** for specific tasks.
- **Integration** with subscribing actions for seamless task execution.
- **Scalability** for handling multiple pulse triggers.

---

### Configuration Structure

The action accepts direct entries under the `config` parameter, which can be specified in the agent descriptor entry for the action. Below is an example:

```yaml
- action: jivas/pulse_action
    context:
        enabled: true
        version: ">=0.0.1"
        config:
            DHBReportUpdateInteractAction: every().day.at("05:30", "America/Guyana")
```

### Syntax for the `config` Parameter

The `config` parameter accepts key-value mappings where the key is the action label, and the value is the scheduling specification. The scheduling syntax follows the conventions outlined in the [schedule library documentation](https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html).

```python
config = {
        # Example key-value mappings
        "PulseAction": "every(5).seconds",
        "XYZAction": "every(1).hour.until('2030-01-01 18:00')"
}
```

---

### Programmatic Configuration Management

Once a reference to the `pulse_action` is acquired, you can programmatically add or remove schedule entries using the following methods:

#### Adding a Schedule Entry

```python
pulse_action = self.get_agent().get_actions().get(action_label="PulseAction")
pulse_action.add_schedule("MyOwnAction", "every(1).hour.until('2030-01-01 18:00')")
```

#### Removing a Schedule Entry

```python
pulse_action.remove_schedule("MyOwnAction")
```

### Method Definitions

- **`add_schedule(action_label: str, interval_spec: str)`**
    Adds a new schedule entry for the specified action and interval.
    Example:
    ```python
    pulse_action.add_schedule("MyOwnAction", "every(1).hour.until('2030-01-01 18:00')")
    ```

- **`remove_schedule(action_label: str)`**
    Removes an existing schedule entry for the specified action.
    Example:
    ```python
    pulse_action.remove_schedule("MyOwnAction")
    ```

These methods allow dynamic management of schedules, enabling flexibility and scalability for task execution.

### Best Practices
- Validate your task identifiers and parameters before deployment.
- Test pulse schedules in a staging environment before production use.
